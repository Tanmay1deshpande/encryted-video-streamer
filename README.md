# encryted-video-streamer

An application used to upload an encrypted video file, playable only while using apache kafka

Data Flow
User Uploads Video:

The user selects a video file from the UI.
The video is encrypted on the frontend before sending it to the backend for storage.
Backend (Flask):

The backend receives the encrypted video and stores it in the server.
The backend also saves the videoâ€™s metadata (e.g., name, size, encryption info) in the database.
Once the video is stored, the backend will create a Kafka topic to stream video chunks and publish the metadata.
Kafka Streaming:

Kafka will break the video into chunks and publish these chunks as messages in a Kafka topic.
The frontend will subscribe to the Kafka topic and receive video chunks for playback.
Frontend (React):

The frontend listens to Kafka topics and streams the video chunks for display using a video player.
